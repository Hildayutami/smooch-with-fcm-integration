# smooch-with-fcm-integration

Smooch lets you have rich conversations with your users, right in your app or on your website. If you want to learn more about Smooch, then visit our website at http://smooch.io or sign up here. This page provides in-depth documentation on Smoochâ€™s features and is meant to be a guide for developers integrating the SDK and app makers seeking to engage with their users.

I've already implement FCM on this project and also integrate to Slack for receiveng the message from user.
